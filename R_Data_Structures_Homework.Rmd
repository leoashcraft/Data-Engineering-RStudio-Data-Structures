# R: Data Structures

## Homework

1.  Create an array of two 3x3 matrices from the given vectors.

```{r}
first_vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
second_vector <- c(9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)
x3 <- array(c(first_vector,second_vector),dim = c(3,3,2))
x3
```

2.  In the above matrix that you created, print the value 5 by indexing in to the matrix.

3.  Print the third row of the first matrix.

4.  Print the second column of both matrices.

    ```{r}
    x3[2,2,2]
    ```

    ```{r}
    x3[3,,1]
    ```

    ```{r}
    x3[,2,]
    ```
